# Takes 2 to Mango : Back-End

This is my capstone project for the BrainStation WebDev bootcamp backend repo. It is intended to be used along with the capstone font end repo. 



## Tech Stack

**Server:** Node and Express, JSON file for data persistence 




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shmu305/brainstation-capstone-server.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd brainstation-capstone-server
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm node index.js
```


## Roadmap

I was planning to use a PostgreSQL server for this project. I plan to refactor the current backend and integrate the data into a PostgreSQL database.
